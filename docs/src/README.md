# Introduction

**polymath** is a highly modular open source web crawler.
It has been designed to be easily modular during its processing phases.
And it has other qualities too:
* Support PDF by default
* Can be used via a CLI or Kafka*
* Low CPU and RAM usage, thanks to Rust

\* HTTP API is planned, but wouldn't be enabled by default.
